## System Overview

This repository contains two different implementations of the same healthcare decision support system:

### Method 1: Google ADK Implementation
- **Framework**: Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- **Model**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini via LiteLLM
- **Architecture**: Single agent with multiple tools
- **Features**: Session management, preference learning, user feedback
- **Port**: 8000

### Method 2: CrewAI Implementation
- **Framework**: CrewAI
- **Model**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Architecture**: Multi-agent crew with specialized roles
- **Features**: Session memory, conversational AI, adaptive query routing
- **Port**: 8001

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Method 1 (Google ADK)

```bash
cd "method 1"
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Configure .env with GOOGLE_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY
adk web .
```

Open http://localhost:8000

### Method 2 (CrewAI)

```bash
cd "method 2"
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Configure .env with OPENAI_API_KEY
python main.py
```

Open http://localhost:8001

## 📊 Features Comparison

| Feature | Method 1 (Google ADK) | Method 2 (CrewAI) |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Framework | Google ADK | CrewAI |
| Architecture | Single Agent | Multi-Agent Crew |
| Session Management | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Custom |
| Preference Learning | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| User Feedback | ✅ Like/Dislike | ❌ No |
| Conversational AI | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Advanced |
| Query Routing | ❌ No | ✅ Adaptive |
| Response Speed | Fast | Moderate |
| Setup Complexity | Medium | Easy |

## 🎯 Use Cases

### When to Use Method 1 (Google ADK)
- Need preference learning and user feedback
- Want built-in session management
- Prefer Google's ecosystem
- Need faster response times

### When to Use Method 2 (CrewAI)
- Need multi-agent collaboration
- Want better conversational AI
- Prefer OpenAI-only stack
- Need adaptive query routing

## 📋 Common Features

Both implementations provide:

- **Hospital Data Analysis**: 40+ metrics per hospital
- **Distance Calculations**: Between hospitals with travel time estimates
- **Resource Tracking**: Beds, ICU, ventilators, staff, supplies
- **Analytics**: Trends, comparisons, system-wide statistics
- **Web Interface**: Modern, responsive UI
- **Session Memory**: Remembers user context

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Common Technologies
- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI (web framework)
- Pandas (data analysis)
- OpenAI (embeddings)
- MongoDB Atlas (optional RAG)

### Method 1 Specific
- Google ADK
- LiteLLM
- Google Gemini models

### Method 2 Specific
- CrewAI
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini

## 📊 Sample Data

Both methods use the same sample dataset:
- **5 Hospitals** across different regions
- **7 Days** of data (2024-10-20 to 2024-10-26)
- **40+ Metrics** per hospital including:
  - Bed capacity and utilization
  - ICU and ventilator status
  - Staff availability
  - Patient activity
  - Supplies and equipment
  - Infectious disease cases

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Method 1 (.env)**:
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri (optional)
```

**Method 2 (.env)**:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri (optional)
```

## 💬 Example Queries

Try these queries with either implementation:

### Conversational
```
"Hello"
"My name is John"
"What is my name?"
```

### Data Queries
```
"How many hospitals are there?"
"List all hospitals"
"Show me beds at City General Hospital"
"What's the ICU capacity?"
```

### Analytics
```
"Compare City General Hospital and Regional Medical Center"
"Show system-wide statistics"
"Analyze capacity trends"
```

### Distance & Location
```
"Calculate distance between City General Hospital and Metropolitan Hospital"
"Show all hospital distances"
"Find nearest hospital to District Hospital"
```
